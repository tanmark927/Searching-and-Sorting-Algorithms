# Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms
This is a set of files that feature handwritten algorithms for well-known searching and sorting algorithms.

Lab 1 and Lab 2 involve merge sort, linear search, and binary search.

Lab 3 involves quick sort and insertion sort.

Lab 4 involves heap sort and selection sort.

Lab 5 involves breadth first search and depth first search.

MSS involves maximum subsequence sum using divide-and-conquer method and linear search for maximum value.

RandomizedFind involves searching for the kth least element in an array.
